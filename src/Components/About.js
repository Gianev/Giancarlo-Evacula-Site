                        Hey, I'm Giancarlo but you can say Gian. I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at TMU. I love playing playing volleyball
                        and working out. I especially love listening to music while I work out and when I do homework. I also love food and I always
                        search for new places in the GTA to try and review. I sometimes like playing video games as well, especially Lethal Company.

                        On my spare time, I like creating programs like discord bots, websites, and small video games. I want to get into more
                        full-stack development as it incorporates alot of cool ideas together to form a nice website. Additionally, I am interested
                        in tweaking with AI programs. I want to create something that uses AI, as it has been the recent boom for many companies.
                        My current goal is to create a workout tracker that uses AI to allow for people to see their progress more easily by
                        using an AI to create queries that go into a database that stores their statistics and then using that query to visualize
                        their progress.
                    </p>
